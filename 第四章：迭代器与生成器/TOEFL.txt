As we all know, both classmates and parents have great impact on child’s performance in school.
But I am inclined to contend that parents play a dominant role, my points are as follows.
Children spend more time with parents over classmates, they have shared laughters and teers with families.
But in school, students only stay together with limited time.
Therefore parents understand their kids better than anyone in school, they know their mood, weekness and strength.
For example, If a kid is shy in pulibic, the parents would encourage him to participate more social events in order to
getting confident to raise her own opinion. On the other hand, parents show more sophisticate and border perspective in many ways than the children.
Thus they could give chidren valueable suggestions, such as value of learning, developing their own interest in different expect in shchool.
At the same time, classmates usually focus on assignments or ranking in grades. Based on my personal experience,
when I graduated from senior high school, I am confused about which major I should choose in colleage.
My parents provided me some convincing reasons according to my perception, interest and dominance.
They fully understand most majors’ core competitiveness and what kind of potential career they are related
to since both of them had studied in colleage. In a word, parents are able to have a more significant influence than classmates
on child’s behavior in shcool , and help their kids tremendously for pursuing success.
